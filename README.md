# Collegues Q&A
## What is a project exactly, what can it do?
- Let's keep things simple. For the first iteration a project made of a title, a description and a status.
- Any user can create a project
- Any user can comment on any project as many times as they want
- Any user can change the status of a project

## Do we need authentification/login?
- Yes, we have users that can add comments to a project so those users will need to have accounts and login

## Can we use gems?
- Yes, we don't really want to reinvent the wheel.


## Notes
- I tried to focus on the core functionality, due to a lack of time I built this like a spike/prototype, meant to spark a conversation or to agree on a solution on how to implement this feature.
- The audit decorator might need a factory pattern
- Didn't focus on design due to lack of time.
- For a better user experience Turbo frames can be used, lack of time again
